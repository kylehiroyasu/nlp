## Introduction
Reviews Content via Notebooks and Implementations as shown in Jurafsky NLP Book. This repo was created to help me review material and implement some of the concepts presented in the book. I may lift exact wording from this or other materials without citation and don't claim this text as an original work.

## Datasets

Datasets were mostly found via the following [resource](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets)

## Running Notebooks

Assuming you have jupyter installed you can use the `requirements.txt` to install all additional dependencies.


## Presentation

The notebooks are acessible via the repo or via [gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@kylehiroyasu/s/nlp/)
