    "# Minimum Edit Distance and Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task in NLP is to measure how similar two different texts are. An old school way of approaching this problem, sans neural networks, is to simply measure how many additions and deletions would it take to start from text A and arrive at text B. For example we could imagine news headlines which are in down to the character level very similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"President Obama spoke today in the Rose Garden\"\n",
    "    \"Barack Obama spoke in the Rose Garden\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Strictly speaking the strings are different, however they are very similar in wording, and even convey similar meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with determining how many edits does it take to start from text A and arrive at text B is that we must **search** for the the fewest amount of edits possible. To achieve this we will rely on **dynamic programming** which is a class of algorithms which relies on tables to solve the problem. Two examples which will come up frequently are **Viterbi** and **CKY**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea in such algorithms is that we incrementally brute force all possibilities, however we keep track of each step and its associated cost. Thus when we have completed trying all possible combinations, we can retrace the steps which led to the lowest cost solution. To illustrate this concept we can program the algorithm. After that we will quickly review a few libraries which help you do this."
